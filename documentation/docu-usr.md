##Getting started
{:.no_toc}
This user documentation shows some functionalities of OpenIndy and the way it works.
To show this, we have some measurement tasks.
It is described in detail in the [measurement](/documentation/docu-usr/measurement.html) section.

The guide is structured in the following sections:

###[Preperation](/documentation/docu-usr/preperation.html)

This section describes all steps you have to do for preparing your OpenIndy software, before you can solve the task.
