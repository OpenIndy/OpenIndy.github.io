OpenIndy is a metrology software solution that can be extended by [plugins](https://github.com/OpenIndy/OiPluginTemplate). The project started in 2013 as a student project in the Department of Geoinformatics and Surveying ([HS Mainz](https://www.hs-mainz.de/studium/studiengaenge/technik/geoinformatik-bsc-kombinierter-studiengang/uebersicht/)). Our primary goal is to attract students and to jointly develop and learn.
