The version 0.2.1 of OpenIndy is now available. It is an alpha version and is therefor not intended for productive use, yet.
Nevertheless you may play around with it and maybe even give use feedback. <br>

OpenIndy is delivered with a default plugin which contains basic functionality for fitting geometries like planes, circles, spheres etc..
Furthermore there is a virtual laser tracker implementation available which simulates a real laser tracker. <br>

If you have got any questions please do not hesitate to send us a [mail](https://openindy.github.io/posts/contact.html). <br>

You may download the source a the compiled binaries (Windows 7 32bit) [here](https://openindy.github.io/download/).
